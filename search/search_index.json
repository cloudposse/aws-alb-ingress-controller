A sample IAM policy, with the minimum permissions to run the controller, can be found in examples/alb-iam-policy.json .

However, only ingress resources that contain the required annotations will be satisfied by the ALB Ingress Controller. You can further limit the ingresses your controller has access to. The options available are limiting the ingress class ( ingress.class ) or limiting the namespace watched ( --watch-namespace= ). Each approach is detailed below.

Ingress Behavior \u00b6 Periodically, ingress update events are seen by the controller. The controller retains a list of all ingress resources it knows about, along with the current state of AWS components that satisfy them. When an update event is fired, the controller re-scans the list of ingress resources known to the cluster and determines, by comparing the list to its previously stored one, the ingresses requiring deletion, creation or modification. An example ingress, from example/2048/2048-ingress.yaml is as follows. apiVersion : extensions/v1beta1 kind : Ingress metadata : name : \"nginx-ingress\" namespace : \"2048-game\" annotations : kubernetes.io/ingress.class : alb labels : app : 2048-nginx-ingress spec : rules : - host : 2048.example.com http : paths : - path : / backend : serviceName : \"service-2048\" servicePort : 80 The host field specifies the eventual Route 53-managed domain that will route to this service. The service, service-2048, must be of type NodePort (see ../examples/echoservice/echoserver-service.yaml ) in order for the provisioned ALB to route to it. If no NodePort exists, the controller will not attempt to provision resources in AWS. For details on purpose of annotations seen above, see Annotations .

Example: alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: access_logs.s3.enabled=true,access_logs.s3.bucket=my-access-log-bucket backend-protocol : Enables selection of protocol for ALB to use to connect to backend service. When omitted, HTTP is used. certificate-arn : Enables HTTPS and uses the certificate defined, based on arn, stored in your AWS Certificate Manager . healthcheck-interval-seconds : The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. The default is 15 seconds. healthcheck-path : The ping path that is the destination on the targets for health checks. The default is /. healthcheck-port : The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. The default is traffic-port, which indicates the port on which each target receives traffic from the load balancer. healthcheck-protocol : The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on targets. The default is the HTTP protocol. healthcheck-timeout-seconds : The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response from a target means a failed health check. The default is 5 seconds. healthcheck-healthy-threshold-count : The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. The default is 2. healthcheck-unhealthy-threshold-count : The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy. The default is 2. listen-ports : Defines the ports the ALB will expose. It defaults to [{\"HTTP\": 80}] unless a certificate ARN is defined, then it is [{\"HTTPS\": 443}] . Uses a format as follows '[{\"HTTP\":8080,\"HTTPS\": 443}]'. inbound-cidrs : Defines the CIDR whitelist for ingress traffic to ALB. It defaults to 0.0.0.0/0 .(Will be ignored if security-groups is specified) target-type : Defines if the EC2 instance ID or the pod IP are used in the managed Target Groups. Defaults to instance . Valid options are instance and ip . With instance the Target Group targets are <ec2 instance id>:<node port> , for ip the targets are <pod ip>:<pod port> . ip is to be used when the pod network is routable and can be reached by the ALB. scheme : Defines whether an ALB should be internal or internet-facing . See Load balancer scheme in the AWS documentation for more details. security-groups : Security groups that should be applied to the ALB instance. These can be referenced by security group IDs or the name tag associated with each security group. Example ID values are sg-723a380a,sg-a6181ede,sg-a5181edd . Example tag values are appSG, webSG . When the annotation is not present, the controller will create a security group with appropriate ports allowing access to 0.0.0.0/0 and attached to the ALB. It will also create a security group for instances that allows all TCP traffic when the source is the security group created for the ALB. subnets : The subnets where the ALB instance should be deployed. Must include 2 subnets, each in a different availability zone . These can be referenced by subnet IDs or the name tag associated with the subnet. Example values for subnet IDs are subnet-a4f0098e,subnet-457ed533,subnet-95c904cd . Example values for name tags are: webSubnet,appSubnet . If subnets are not specified the ALB controller will attempt to detect qualified subnets. This qualification is done by locating subnets that match the following criteria. kubernetes.io/cluster/$CLUSTER_NAME where $CLUSTER_NAME is the same cluster name specified on the ingress controller. The value of this tag must be shared or owned . kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb should be set to 1 or an empty tag value for internal load balancers. kubernetes.io/role/elb should be set to 1 or an empty tag value for internet-facing load balancers. After subnets matching the above 2 tags have been located, they are checked to ensure 2 or more are in unique AZs, otherwise the ALB will not be created. If 2 subnets share the same AZ, only 1 of the 2 is used. success-codes : Defines the HTTP status code that should be expected when doing health checks against the defined healthcheck-path . When omitted, 200 is used. tags : Defines AWS Tags that should be applied to ALB instance, Target groups and SecurityGroups. target-group-attributes : Defines Target Group Attributes which can be assigned to the Target Groups. Currently these are applied equally to all target groups in the ingress. ip-address-type : The IP address type thats used to either route IPv4 traffic only or to route both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. Can be either dualstack or ipv4 . When omitted ipv4 is used. ssl-policy : Defines the Security Policy that should be assigned to the ALB, allowing you to control the protocol and ciphers. alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.\\ : Provides a method for configuring custom actions on a listener, such as for Redirect Actions . The <ACTION NAME> in the annotation must match the serviceName in the ingress rules. The value of the annotation is the JSON spec of the action.

For a fixed-response, use alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.fixed-response-error: '{\"Type\": \"fixed-response\", \"FixedResponseConfig\": {\"ContentType\":\"text/plain\", \"StatusCode\":\"503\", \"MessageBody\":\"503 error text\"}}' with a serviceName : fixed - response - error and servicePort : use - annotation .

Via tags on the subnets \u00b6 When subnet annotations are not present, the controller will attempt to choose the best subnets for deploying the ALBs. It uses the following tag criteria to determine the subnets it should use. kubernetes.io/cluster/$CLUSTER_NAME equal to shared or owned . $CLUSTER_NAME must match the CLUSTER_NAME environment variable on the controller. And one of the following: kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb: \"\" For internal load balancers kubernetes.io/role/elb = \"\" For internet-facing load balancers Security Group Selection \u00b6 The controller determines if it should create and manage security groups or use existing ones in AWS based on the presence of an annotation. When alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups is present, the list of security groups is assigned to the ALB instance. When the annotation is not present, the controller will create a security group with appropriate ports allowing access to 0.0.0.0/0 and attached to the ALB. It will also create a security group for instances that allows all TCP traffic when the source is the security group created for the ALB.
